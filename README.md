# rrc - Manage remote repository clones

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rrc.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/rrc)

`rrc` is a remote repository management tool like [ghq][1] written in Rust.

`rrc` provides a way to organize remote repository clones, like go get does.

`rrc` makes a directory under a specific root directory (by default ~/repos) using the remote repository URLâ€™s host and path.

## Installation

```shell
$ cargo install rrc
```

## Usage

`rrc` command is almost compatible with [ghq][1].

```
rrc

USAGE:
    rrc [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --config <FILE>    Set config file

SUBCOMMANDS:

    get       Clone remote repository
    help      Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

    remove    Remove local repositories

```

For how to use this tool, [ghq-handbook][2] will be helpful.

## Config

`rrc` provides a simple toml-style configuration file.

The configuration file can set profile name in the section. You can then select a profile with command line options. And you can also set host filters. If you set a host filter, it will be enabled across profiles.

```toml
# default profile
[default]
# customize repo root path
root = "~/repos"

# personal profile
[personal]
# customize repo root path
root = "~/personal_repos"
# hosts filter. gitlab repository cloned '~/personal_repos'
hosts = ["gitlab.com"]

```
